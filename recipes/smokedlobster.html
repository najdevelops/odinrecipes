    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4oz lobster tails</li>
      <li>kosher salt</li>
      <li>black pepper</li>
      <li>butter</li>
      <li>garlic</li>
      <li>juice of a lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your smoker to 250°F.</li>
      <li>Butterfly your lobster tails and pull the meat out of the shell.</li>
      <li>Season the lobster meat with salt, pepper</li>
      <li>
        Place the lobster directly on the grates of your smoker with the
        meat-side facing upwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small pot or pan, combine the butter, garlic powder, and lemon
        juice
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the pot on the smoker next to the lobster. The butter should melt
        within 5 to 10 minutes, leaving you with a simple butter sauce for
        basting
      </li>
      <li>Baste the lobster every 10-15 minutes with the butter sauce.</li>
      <li>
        After 45 minutes of cook time, or when the lobster reaches an internal
        temperature of 145°F, pull the lobster off the smoker and serve
        alongside the remaining butter sauce and an extra squeeze of lemon
        juice.
      </li>
    </ol>
